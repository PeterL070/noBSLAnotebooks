No bullshit guide to linear algebra notebooks
=============================================

Jupyter notebooks with exercises for the [*No bullshit guide to linear algebra*](https://gum.co/noBSLA).

Abstract
--------
Linear algebra is the study of vectors and linear transformations.
You may be familiar with vectors from learning about them in physics class,
but in linear algebra vectors will play a central role so you'll get to know
them very well, and also study the types of functions you can apply to vectors.
In particular we'll study the linear transformations, which are functions that
take vectors as inputs and produce vectors as outputs.
Linear transformations can be represented by matrices, thus we can also say that
linear algebra is the study of vectors and matrices.
